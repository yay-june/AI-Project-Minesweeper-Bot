# AI-Project-Minesweeper-Bot

CSC 4444
AI Project

    This project was created on vscode. To run the project, you can simply click the "Run" button at the top right between "Go" and "Terminal" 
    then click "Start Debugging". I have not tried running this project on any other IDE, but I can confidently say that you can still run this 
    through the run function that that IDE provides.

    A window will pop up once the project is running. Click on the window to be on it.

        Press 'x' to generate a new minefield.
        Press 'c' for the AI to solve the minefield.
            You must press c for each step that the AI takes. 

    You can generate a minefield at anytime.
    You can exit the program by closing the minesweeper window.
